Hello! This is the blog of me, Validusername16. The purpose of this site is to allow me to have a public facing place to document my insane ramblings, probably related to some kind of Japanese media released unofficially.
I plan to primarily focus on writing about topics related to unofficial anime and manga releases, including Anime Fansubs, Bootleg DVDs, and other fan translations, although I can and probably will end up writing about other topics along the way.

If you need to contact me about something related to this site, the easiest way would be via Discord @validusername16. I am not on any public social media such as Twitter or Bluesky.
