## Introduction

This is another episode of XenonFansubs Yuushi from my notes, this time episode 11, as I felt that the contents of the episode's translation would be worthwhile to document publicly. Same as with Episode 24, this is less of a review and more
a collection of notes on the subtitles to document any errors, mistakes, or oddities. Like with before, ADV's translation is included at the top of all screenshots for reference.

## Subtitles

![Wh / What is it?](/assets/yucie-11/wh-what-is-it.png)<br/>
For some reason at some point XF decided that this was the best way to handle stutters.

<br><br>
![Her lessons and classes could be making her really tired](/assets/yucie-11/lessons-and-classes.png)<br/>
Both her lessons *and* her classes? The poor thing.

<br><br>
![Heart's desire fulfilled, the Girl from the Beach](/assets/yucie-11/title-case.png)<br/>
Don't think this is how title case works, but go off I guess.

<br><br>
![I feel like my spirit has completely been reborn!](/assets/yucie-11/completely-been-reborn.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![So his daughter would be welcome here.](/assets/yucie-11/so-his-daughter-would-be.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![How about you, Grenda-chan?](/assets/yucie-11/grenda-tachi-wa.png)<br/>
The audio here is "Grenda-tachi wa?"

<br><br>
![a summer night with beautiful moonlight](/assets/yucie-11/full-moon.png)<br/>
I'm sure that the full moon was beautiful, but my understanding is that it was specifically a night with a full moon.

<br><br>
![any kind of love will be granted to you.](/assets/yucie-11/any-kind-of-love.png)<br/>
While not inherently wrong, I don't like this wording.

<br><br>
![Haah, lovely water.](/assets/yucie-11/haah-lovely-water.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![I'm going to do it.](/assets/yucie-11/im-going-to-do-it.png)<br/>
What are you going to do? She says this after she throws a pillow at Grenda. I still have no idea what "it" was supposed to be. 

<br><br>
![Eyecatch](/assets/yucie-11/eyecatch.png)<br/>
This is the eyecatch, marking the halfway point of the episode. While nothing is wrong with this eyecatch, I am including it to note that the episode is halfway through, as the translation quality changes dramatically after this point.

<br><br>
![Do you have any idea what the others will think?](/assets/yucie-11/what-the-others-will-think.png)<br/>
I think this is an oversimplification of what he's saying, but it's far from the most offensive thing in this episode.

<br><br>
![Why are you looking at me with that kind of expression?](/assets/yucie-11/why-are-you-looking-at-me.png)<br/>
This line is not only extremely unnaturally written, it's also extremely incorrect. All other things aside, he's not even looking at her. This is also a good time to bring up some important context for the episode.
Last episode, Arc, a boy who Yuushi has a crush on, gave her a kiss as a farewell while on the run. The premise of this episode is that Yuushi is now trying to think through her feelings, 
and decide if he has the same feelings for her as she does for him, or if he was just messing with her, as he has been known to do. Her friends watched the kiss unfold, and earlier in this episode confronted her on it,
with Grenda trying to convince her that she should just forget it ever happened. This sequence was not included in screenshots, as XF's translator actually did get the contents of it correct.

<br><br>
![Stop daydreaming.](/assets/yucie-11/stop-daydreaming.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![Well my friends were there, so...](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-01.png)<br/>
This marks the start of a very long and very incorrect sequence in the translation. Yuushi meets a mysterious girl on the beach who she talks through her feelings with, and so the entire episode hinges on this sequence being
correctly translated. We begin by losing that she was talking about what her friends said today in this sentence, and not what happened the previous day.

<br><br>
![Was it for real, or was it just to fool around with me?](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-02.png)<br/>
Continuing on, since we got the previous line incorrect, the fact that she's describing what Grenda thought is now lost.

<br><br>
![But it wouldn't matter, would it?](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-03.png)<br/>
I believe that the line here is completely wrong.

<br><br>
![Don't worry about it.](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-04.png)<br/>
Don't worry about what? ADV has the same thought as XF's previous line, but the correct subject that ADV is referring to is clear.

<br><br>
![You don't even know if you like him.](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-05.png)<br/>
At this point, the translation is bordering on nonsense. "Because you still have that person in your mind" doesn't really make sense at all. And while Yuushi hasn't fully decided for sure that she loves him,
I don't think that her saying that "You don't even know if you like him." prompts the next line.

<br><br>
![Does he like me? Arc still sees me as a child.](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-06.png)<br/>
No, she said that you might even love him, not if he loves you.

<br><br>
![Things like that don't matter.](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-07.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![Even if you don't know yourself, the felling will come to you.](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-08.png)<br/>
The felling, huh? Also the entire meaning of the line seems to have been completely lost in the translation. The "felling" of what?

<br><br>
![Think about this:](/assets/yucie-11/main-sequence-09.png)<br/>
To culminate the entire scene, the girl gives Yuushi this speech about how she shouldn't worry about what the guy thinks of her, and should decide and focus on her own feelings first.
Unfortunately, XF subtitled her lines with this text, which seems to have absolutely nothing to do with what she is saying, and barely even makes any sense in English. "Even if I like someone, I feel I can do it."
I remember while watching this episode I was hopelessly lost on what the girl was even trying to say, but then when I checked ADV's translation everything became clear. This was by far the most important scene in the entire episode,
and the translator completely messed up almost every line in it.

<br><br>
![Do we even know the location?](/assets/yucie-11/do-we-even-know-the-location.png)<br/>
Moving on from that, at some point before this, the robot butler Barizan sunk into the water after crashing into their boat. We know where he fell in, but not where he ended up. I don't think that XF's line conveys this properly.

<br><br>
![I have a status level to keep!](/assets/yucie-11/a-status-level.png)<br/>
Generally on things like this where XF and ADV have completely different meanings, I'm more inclined to believe whatever ADV says.

<br><br>
![Oh, more words.](/assets/yucie-11/oh-more-words.png)<br/>
Well said, Cube.

<br><br>
![give up and go home like this?](/assets/yucie-11/give-up-and-go-home.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![What is?](/assets/yucie-11/what-is.png)<br/>
What is?

<br><br>
![Yuushi-sama? This can't be. Is this possible? Please help me.](/assets/yucie-11/robot-talking.png)<br/>
I think the robot talks too robotic, a feat that I didn't think was possible. I think the third sentence is the worst offender.

<br><br>
![You should of taken responsibility for this.](/assets/yucie-11/you-should-of-taken-responsibility.png)<br/>
You should of taken responsibility.

<br><br>
![Even if my chances look small, I still think I can do it.](/assets/yucie-11/my-chances-look-small.png)<br/>
This is a follow up to the long-winded incorrect sequence from before. XF's translation of this line makes about as much sense as the lines its referring to, which is to say it doesn't make any sense at all.

<br><br>
![Isn't this the fish that Gaga-san caught last night? Right?](/assets/yucie-11/right.png)<br/>
The phrasing of the first sentence does not go well with the "Right?" as a follow up.

<br><br>
![Itadakimasu!](/assets/yucie-11/itadakimasu.png)<br/>
One of the earlier translators wrote a TL note for this in a different episode, but the translator here takes the time to explain it again in case you forgot.

<br><br>
![Yesterday, weren't your actions the same?](/assets/yucie-11/werent-your-actions-the-same.png)<br/>
I don't even know anymore at this point. I have no idea what actions XF thinks that she's referring to.

<br><br>
![Alright, my party arrangements for Yuushi are complete.](/assets/yucie-11/yuushis-party.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![Why are they riding on something like that?](/assets/yucie-11/why-are-they-riding.png)<br/>
What?

<br><br>
![Hold on, something of importance came to mind](/assets/yucie-11/missing-line.png)<br/>
XF missed the final line of the episode. Because the translator screwed up the line about being tan, the entire preview was already made into nonsense. They then gave Gunberd's followup line to Cube, and skipped the last line entirely.
A fitting end to the episode, really.


## Final Thoughts
The first half of the episode seemed above average for this show, with only some minor mistakes here and there. Unfortunately, after the halway point, the quality takes a spectacular nosedive, and the entire episode falls apart.
