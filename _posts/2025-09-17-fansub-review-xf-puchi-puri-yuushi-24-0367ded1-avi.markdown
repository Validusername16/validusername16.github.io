## Background

A while back I thought it would be a fun experiment to try watching the show Puchi Puri Yuushi, also called "Petite Princess Yucie" in official releases,
using the original TV fansubs as released by [XenonFansubs](https://anidb.net/group/125/anime/296/release) back in the early 2000s. This turned out to be a terrible idea, as I quickly realized that XenonFansubs' work was not up to par.
The subtitles were littered with mistranslations that even I, someone who did not know the source language, was able to quickly catch onto, and the editing did not manage to make the subtitles read
even remotely naturally in English. After a couple episodes, I ended up just watching every episode with ADV's translation on the side, making notes every time I noticed something noteworthy between the two.
This is an excerpt of my notes for a single episode, Episode 24, to provide an example of the average quality of an episode of the show released by this group. As such, it is not much of a review, but
I hope that it can still be informative or at least amusing in some way. All screenshots feature ADV's DVD translation on the top of the screen for reference.

This post contains spoilers for events that occur at the climax of the show.

## The Subtitles

![They're all here, the Crystal Flowers](/assets/yucie-24/theyre-all-here.png)<br/>
Japanese sentence structure rendered in English was a common occurrence throughout this show, and episode 24 was no exception to this.

<br><br>
![must now go to Archmage Megazerent and consult her as your final test](/assets/yucie-24/archmage-magazerent.jpg)<br/>
Names being inconsistent isn't a huge deal, as I don't think that ADV and XF agreed on more than one name in the entire show. What is a problem is "the final test".
XF's translator used "test" in all lines of dialogue instead of the intended セーヌ except for one specific time, and so without looking you could be lead to believe that the Final Test and the Final Scene were two different things.
Also, "consult her as your final test"? Was that the best wording they could come up with?

<br><br>
![Don't get all 'fraidy after making it all the way here!](/assets/yucie-24/all-fraidy.png)<br/>
XF's writing was usually so stiff and lifeless that I started noting down any time they wrote something that sounded even remotely creative. I still wasn't exactly sold on the line itself here, but it was still better than everyone talking like robots!

<br><br>
![We are blessed by all these people!](/assets/yucie-24/blessed-by-all-these-people.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![I'm so much in L-O-V-E](/assets/yucie-24/l-o-v-e.png)<br/>
Well, it's not the worst handling of love-love I've seen I guess.

<br><br>
![that I'm the one who will be selected the Platinum Princess!](/assets/yucie-24/the-one-who-will-selected.png)<br/>
If I'm going to call out XF on their mistakes, I may as well do the same for ADV.<br>They forgot the word "as".

<br><br>
![These girls haven't changed one bit, even after graduation.](/assets/yucie-24/havent-changed-one-bit.png)<br/>
This line isn't well written, but the important thing to note is that graduation by this point has already happened. We actually watch it happen a few minutes earlier. This is important, because two lines later, the translation writes...

<br>
![It is finally time for graduation.](/assets/yucie-24/it-is-finally-time-for-graduation.png)<br/>
...this. I could care less about the Gate's speech tic being dropped (he ends all his lines with -gate. Two of XF's translators dropped it, the third left a TL note about how it was like Di-Gi Charat), but graduation already happened, so it is not finally time for graduation.

<br><br>
![Those are the Princess Academy's graduates!](/assets/yucie-24/those-are-the-graduates.png)<br/>
Uh... I think that's only one Princess Academy graduate, but whatever you say guys.

<br><br>
![That you can become the Platina Princess... I do believe it.](/assets/yucie-24/i-do-believe-it.png)<br/>
After a while I tried to stop writing down sentences that were solely bad because of the sentence structure, but I couldn't stop myself with some of these because they just read so poorly.

<br><br>
![I ordered that nobody is allowed to be in here!](/assets/yucie-24/i-ordered-that.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![why is he in that condition?](/assets/yucie-24/why-is-he-in-that-condition.png)<br/>
Why is he in that condition?

<br><br>
![This is](/assets/yucie-24/this-is.png)<br/>
This is this, this is that, why is everything this?

<br><br>
![Frame blending](/assets/yucie-24/frame-blended.png)<br/>
As mentioned above, the raw of this episode was improperly decimated, meaning that almost every scene in the show was incredibly choppy, as frames of animation were just outright missing. Every once in a while, though, we'd get a treat
where the frames were there but blended instead! It still didn't look much better though.

<br><br>
![Congratulations for graduating!](/assets/yucie-24/congratulations-for-graduating.png)<br/>
Congratulations for graduating!

<br><br>
![Letting people graduate with this sort of results...](/assets/yucie-24/this-sort-of-results.png)<br/>
Honestly, I don't really like either of these lines. ADV is at least grammatically correct though.

<br><br>
![Really? That is nice to believe in.](/assets/yucie-24/that-is-nice-to-believe-in.png)<br/>
Case in point of everyone talking like robots.

<br><br>
![It's the time of decision.](/assets/yucie-24/its-the-time-of-decision.png)<br/>
I remember while watching the episode I had my text editor scrolled to this line in ADV before reaching the line in the video, and thinking to myself, "wow ADV's line sounds kind of stiff". Then I saw what XF had put there.

<br><br>
![Who... will be chosen?](/assets/yucie-24/who-will-be-chosen.png)<br/>
This one, as far as I can tell, is just an outright translation error. There haven't been a ton of these this episode, but they were pretty common in other episodes.

<br><br>
![Dinner preparations are all done!](/assets/yucie-24/dinner-preparations.png)<br/>
I am always saying this

<br><br>
![That is to be expected. You are still in your child form, after all.](/assets/yucie-24/your-child-form.png)<br/>

<br><br>
![There is something that's more important.](/assets/yucie-24/there-is-something-more-important.png)<br/>
Wow, these sentences do not flow well together.

<br><br>
![Tomorrow I can be the one to help another](/assets/yucie-24/be-the-one-to-help-another.png)<br/>
I wish I could be the one to help another.

<br><br>
![You will tell everyone of their fate.](/assets/yucie-24/you-will-tell-everyone.png)<br/>
The next shot is everyone flying away with determined looks on their faces, with only the Queen looking horrified. I don't think everyone heard about their fate, I think only the Queen did.

<br><br>
![Final Scene! The Princess' Choice](/assets/yucie-24/the-final-scene.png)<br/>
This is the only time that the translator gets "The Final Scene" correct. It goes back to being a Test in the next episode.


## Conclusion

This release is not good, and you should not watch it unless you want to see how many ways the team was able to mess up this show. This was actually one of the tamer episodes, since most of the sentences at least roughly lined up with the same meaning as
the official translations from the DVDs. I don't know if I will share the rest of my notes on this show, as with some of the episodes I'm less confident on some of the translation points, but this should at least provide an insight into the quality of the episodes.
